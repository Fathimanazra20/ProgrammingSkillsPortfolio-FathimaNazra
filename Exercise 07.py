# Exercise 07

#Use your newly acquired knowledge of the for loop to complete the following tasks. Print all values to the console in each case.
#1. Write a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
#2. Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
#3. Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
#4. Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
#5. Write a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5. 
#You may include all loops in a single project

#1
print("counting up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1:")
for x in range(0, 51, 1):
    print(x)

print() #blank space to separate outputs

#2
print("counting down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1:")
for y in range(50, -1, -1):
    print(y)

print() #black space to separate outputs

#3
print("counting up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1:")
for z in range(30,51):
    print(z)

print() #blank space to separate outputs

#4
print("counting down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2:")
for p  in range(50, 9, -2):
    print(p)

print() #blank space to separate outputs

#5
print("counting up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5:")
for q in range(100, 201, 5):
    print(q)
